    Add solutions in here
    Quick checks - are we already in the desired position?
        - Can we even satisfy the condition given the state of the elevators?

    Could work backwards from the known beginning and known end
    since we know the start and the end.
    If you start in elevator A, and need to get to floor 5 by t=5 then
    you wouldn't want to go back down to floor 1 because you'd run out
    of steps to get to floor 5
    But there could be issues with this approach

    const path = ['A', 'D'];
    
    Thought about trying to, "merge" the states/array indicies and give a given elevator coordinates
    E.g. 
        xx.x.x.xDxx
        xx.x.x.x.xx
        xx.x.x.x.xx
        xx.xBx.x.xx
        xx.x.xCx.xx
        xxAx.x.x.xx

    Here A would be (1,1) where t=1 and A is on the first floor
    C is (1, 2) again t=1 and C is on the second floor
    B is (1, 3)

    So if we were to, "merge" all of the states together we could assign coordinates
    to every elevator position
